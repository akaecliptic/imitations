There were quite a few thing I liked about this site:

- The parallax effect
- The stitching of images with videos
- And the overall aesthetics

Its strengths are in its simplicity.

As a challenge, I tried not to use inspect elements (well, except for figuring how to stitch the first section). 
And the parallax effect was crudely done with JS, rather than what I suspect is a css approach in the original site.

Also, the artist's [work](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6J3RPKUwZlKMzh3vWa9wPc "Spotify") for your consideration.
